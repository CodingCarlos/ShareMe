# ShareMe
Testing the Social Sharing phonegap plugin (https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/SocialSharing-PhoneGap-Plugin).

The basic idea is creating an easy to use and replicable code for social sharing, that shares the same content adapted to any plataform with the same call.

This code have been developped thinkink in Phonegap Build (becouse it's easy to use), but should work also with any phonegap project.
